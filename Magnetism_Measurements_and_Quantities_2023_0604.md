Please give me some physical quantities in the context of magnetism with the typical way to measure it by experiment.

Sure, here are some physical quantities related to magnetism along with the typical ways they are measured:

1. **Magnetic Field (B-field)**: This is measured in Tesla (T) and typically measured using a Hall effect sensor, or a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) for very precise measurements. In a laboratory setting, the magnetic field can be manipulated using coils of wire (solenoids).

2. **Magnetic Flux (Φ)**: Measured in Weber (Wb), this is a measure of the total magnetic field passing through a certain area. It can be measured by observing the induced voltage in a loop of wire subject to a changing magnetic field (Faraday's law of induction).

3. **Magnetic Moment (μ)**: This is measured in Am^2 (Ampere square meters) or in the atomic scale as the Bohr magneton (μB). It's commonly measured using techniques like Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

4. **Magnetization (M)**: Measured in A/m (Amperes per meter), this describes the extent to which a material is magnetized. It can be determined by measuring the magnetic field outside of the material and applying the laws of electromagnetism.

5. **Magnetic Susceptibility (χ)**: This is a dimensionless quantity that indicates how much a material will become magnetized in an applied magnetic field. This can be measured by observing the change in magnetization of a sample as the magnetic field changes.

6. **Magnetic Permeability (μ)**: Measured in H/m (Henry per meter), this is a measure of how much a material can become magnetized, or more technically, how much magnetic flux can be supported in a medium. It can be determined by measuring the inductance of a coil filled with the material, compared with the inductance of the same coil in vacuum.

7. **Magnetic Field Gradient**: This is the spatial rate of change of the magnetic field, measured in Tesla per meter (T/m). This can be measured by using two Hall effect sensors a known distance apart, and then subtracting and dividing the two field measurements by the distance.

8. **Curie Temperature (Tc)**: This is the temperature above which a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material becomes paramagnetic. This can be measured by heating a sample while measuring its magnetization (or susceptibility), and observing the temperature at which the magnetization suddenly drops.

These measurements often require specialized equipment and careful experimental design to ensure accuracy. Different techniques may be needed depending on the particular materials and conditions being investigated.
