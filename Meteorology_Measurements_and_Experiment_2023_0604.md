Please give me some physical quantities in the context of meteorology with the typical way to measure it by experiment.

Sure, here are some physical quantities measured in the field of meteorology, along with typical ways to measure them:

1. **Temperature**: A critical meteorological variable, the temperature of the air is typically measured with a thermometer. It can be measured at the surface or aloft using weather balloons (radiosondes).

2. **Atmospheric Pressure**: This is the force per unit area exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. It is usually measured with a barometer at the surface. For measurements at different altitudes, radiosondes equipped with pressure sensors are used.

3. **Humidity**: This is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. It can be measured using a hygrometer or a psychrometer. Humidity can also be measured at different altitudes using weather balloons (radiosondes).

4. **Wind Speed and Direction**: These parameters can be measured using an anemometer and wind vane at the surface. Higher up in the atmosphere, they are typically measured using weather balloons (radiosondes), Doppler radar, or LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).

5. **Precipitation**: This is the amount of water (in any form) that falls from the atmosphere to the ground. It can be measured using a rain gauge for liquid precipitation. For snow, a snow gauge or a ruler can be used to measure the snow depth.

6. **Solar Radiation**: It is the measurement of the radiant energy emitted by the sun. Pyranometers are commonly used for measuring global solar radiation.

7. **Cloud Cover and Cloud Type**: While this isn't a "physical quantity" in the same sense as the others, knowing the cloud cover and type is crucial in meteorology. These are typically observed visually and classified according to established guidelines (like the International Cloud Atlas), but instruments like ceilometers and LIDAR can be used for more precise measurements.

8. **Dew Point**: This is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. Dew point can be calculated from temperature and humidity measurements.

9. **Visibility**: It is the distance at which objects or lights can be clearly discerned. It can be measured using visibility sensors or estimated by human observers.

10. **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: This measurement takes into account various pollutants in the air to provide a comprehensive view of air quality. This requires specialized equipment to measure the concentrations of specific pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3).

Note that the field of meteorology relies heavily on remote sensing technology (such as satellites and radar) to measure these and other physical quantities over broad areas and at high altitudes.
