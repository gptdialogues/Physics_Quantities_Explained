Sure, here are some physical quantities in the context of particle physics and the typical way to measure them by experiment:

1. **Particle Mass**: The mass of a particle is often inferred from its momentum and velocity using the formula for relativistic momentum: P = γmv, where γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²). One of the ways this is done is by using particle accelerators, which accelerate particles to high speeds and then deflect them using a magnetic field. The amount of deflection depends on the momentum of the particle, from which the mass can be determined.

2. **Charge**: The electric charge of a particle can be measured by observing its deflection in an electric field, for example using a cloud chamber or a bubble chamber. Different particles will deflect in different amounts, depending on their charge and velocity.

3. **Spin**: The spin of a particle is measured using a variety of techniques, often involving polarized light or the use of magnetic fields. For example, the Stern-Gerlach experiment was famously used to discover the quantization of spin in electrons.

4. **Lifetime/Decay Time**: The mean lifetime of an unstable particle is measured by observing a large number of similar particles and recording the time it takes for them to decay. This is often done using particle detectors at large facilities such as CERN.

5. **Cross Section**: The cross section, which is a measure of the probability of a particular interaction occurring, is measured by bombarding a target with a beam of particles and then counting the number of interactions. The greater the cross section, the higher the probability of interaction.

6. **Magnetic Moment**: The magnetic moment of a particle is often measured using spectroscopic methods. For instance, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is currently being measured with high precision at Fermilab in the United States.

7. **Color Charge**: The color charge of quarks (red, green, or blue) is a fundamental property in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The presence of this charge and its effects can be inferred from high-energy scattering experiments, even though quarks themselves can never be directly observed due to confinement.

Please note that many of these measurements are carried out using complex detectors and require statistical analysis of large amounts of data.
