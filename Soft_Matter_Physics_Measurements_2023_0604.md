Sure, soft matter physics is a subfield of condensed matter physics that deals with materials that are easily deformed by external forces, like liquids, polymers, foams, gels, colloids, and biological materials. Here are some physical quantities often studied in this field and the typical methods for measuring them:

1. **Viscosity**: Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to shear or flow, and it's a fundamental property in soft matter physics. It can be measured with a viscometer or a rheometer.

2. **Elastic Modulus**: This is a measure of a material's stiffness or resistance to deformation. It is typically measured through tensile testing or compression testing, or through techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) or nanoindentation for nanoscale measurements.

3. **Surface Tension**: Surface tension is a property that describes the elastic tendency of a liquid surface. It can be measured using several methods such as the drop weight method, the pendant drop test, or the Wilhelmy plate method.

4. **Particle Size Distribution**: For colloidal systems, the size distribution of the particles is a crucial parameter. Techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron microscopy, or laser diffraction can be used.

5. **Phase Behavior**: In soft matter systems, the phase (e.g., solid, liquid, gas, gel) can have profound effects on the material properties. Methods for determining phase behavior can include differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), rheology, or various forms of spectroscopy.

6. **Molecular Weight Distribution**: In polymers, the distribution of molecular weights can affect the properties of the material. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or gel permeation chromatography (GPC) are commonly used to measure this.

7. **Mechanical Properties**: Yield stress, fracture toughness, and fatigue strength can provide insight into the mechanical behavior of soft materials. These properties can be measured using various techniques such as tensile testing, compression testing, or fatigue testing.

8. **Diffusion Coefficients**: Diffusion coefficients indicate how particles or molecules move in the material, which can be important in biological soft matter or in polymers. This can be measured using techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), or dynamic light scattering (DLS).
   
9. **Zeta Potential**: In colloidal systems, the zeta potential gives information about the charge distribution in the interface between the particle and the surrounding fluid. It is typically measured by electrophoretic light scattering.

Remember that each experimental setup must be calibrated correctly and the material's properties should be within the range of the instrument for the results to be accurate and reliable.
