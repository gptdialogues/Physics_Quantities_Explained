Please give me some physical quantities in the context of quantum computation with the typical way to measure it by experiment.

Sure, I'd be happy to. Quantum computing operates with quantum bits or "qubits", so many of the physical quantities and measurements are different from those in classical computing. Here are some important ones:

1. **Quantum state**: The basic unit of quantum information is a quantum bit or qubit. Unlike a classical bit which can be 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of states. The quantum state of a qubit is typically described by the Bloch sphere. This state can be measured through a variety of techniques depending on the physical system that's being used to implement the qubit. For example, in superconducting qubits, microwave pulses and resonators might be used to measure the quantum state.

2. **Entanglement**: Entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical property where qubits become interlinked, such that the state of one qubit is immediately connected to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. In an experiment, entanglement can be verified through a variety of tests, one famous one being the Bell's inequality test.

3. **Quantum coherence**: Coherence measures the ability of a qubit to remain in a superposition of states. It plays a key role in quantum computing. Coherence times can be determined by various experimental methods such as T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation time measurements. 

4. **Quantum interference**: This is the ability of quantum states to interfere constructively or destructively. It's the principle behind many quantum algorithms. The degree of interference can often be inferred from the outcome of many measurements on identically prepared quantum systems.

5. **Quantum gate fidelity**: This refers to the accuracy with which quantum gates (the basic operations in quantum computing) are implemented. Techniques like randomized benchmarking can be used to measure gate fidelity.

6. **Quantum Process Tomography**: This is used to characterize quantum operations or quantum gates in the computational process. It involves multiple repeated experiments with various initial states and measurement bases to fully characterize the operation.

7. **Quantum State Tomography**: This is a process used to fully characterize a quantum state, i.e., the state of a qubit or group of qubits. It involves a series of measurements in different bases, and subsequent statistical analysis to determine the likely quantum state.

Note that all these measurements are statistical in nature because of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Each individual measurement will cause a collapse of the quantum state to one of the possible outcomes, and only by repeating the experiment many times can the full quantum information be determined.
