Polymer science, also known as polymer physics, encompasses a wide range of properties and quantities that are vital in the understanding and manipulation of polymers. Below are some key physical quantities specific to polymer science, along with their typical experimental measurement techniques:

1. **Molecular Weight**: Molecular weight is a critical property of polymers that can greatly influence their physical and chemical properties. Different types of molecular weights can be measured, such as number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw). Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is commonly used to measure molecular weight distribution of polymers.

2. **Degree of Polymerization**: This is the number of monomeric units in a polymer. It can be calculated from the molecular weight of the polymer and the molecular weight of the repeating unit. 

3. **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)**: The temperature at which a polymer transitions from a hard, glassy material to a soft, rubbery material. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is a common technique for measuring the glass transition temperature.

4. **Melting Temperature (Tm)**: The temperature at which a crystalline polymer turns from a solid state into a liquid state. DSC is also used to measure the melting temperature.

5. **Viscosity**: Viscosity relates to the polymer's flow behavior. It can be measured using a viscometer or rheometer.

6. **Polydispersity Index (PDI)**: This is the ratio of the weight average molecular weight to the number average molecular weight, and it gives an indication of the distribution of molecular weights in a polymer sample. PDI can be determined through Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC).

7. **Mechanical Properties**: These include tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact resistance, among others. They are measured using tensile testing, flexural testing, and impact testing respectively.

8. **Thermal Stability**: Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) can be used to measure the thermal stability of a polymer. This method helps in understanding how a polymer will decompose under high temperatures.

9. **Crystallinity**: The degree of crystallinity in a polymer affects many of its physical properties such as density, melting point, and tensile strength. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC can be used to determine crystallinity.

10. **Chemical Composition**: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are often used to determine the chemical composition of polymers.

Each of these quantities provides unique and important information about a polymer's structure, properties, and performance. As such, they play a critical role in polymer science and engineering.
