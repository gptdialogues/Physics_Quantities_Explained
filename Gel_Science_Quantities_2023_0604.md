Gel science, also known as gel physics or gel technology, deals with the properties of gels, a state of matter that has properties between those of liquids and solids. Various physical quantities are of interest in gel science, and below are some of them with typical experimental measurement techniques:

1. **Viscosity:** The viscosity of a gel is a measure of its resistance to shear or flow. The most common way to measure viscosity is with a viscometer or a rheometer. The sample is placed between two plates and the force required to cause the plates to slide relative to each other is measured.

2. **Elasticity:** The elasticity or elastic modulus of a gel is a measure of its ability to return to its original shape after being deformed. This is typically measured using an oscillatory rheometer, which applies a small oscillating strain or stress and measures the resulting oscillation in stress or strain. The phase shift and amplitude ratio give the storage (elastic) and loss (viscous) moduli.

3. **Porosity:** Porosity is a measure of the void spaces in a material, and in case of gels, it's the proportion of the volume of the gel that is not taken up by the solid network. This can be measured using mercury intrusion porosimetry, where the pressure required to intrude mercury into the pores is measured.

4. **Swelling Ratio:** This is the ratio of the weight of the swollen gel to the weight of the dry gel. This is typically measured by immersing the gel in a swelling agent (often a liquid like water), allowing it to swell to equilibrium, blotting off the surface liquid, and then weighing it.

5. **Diffusion Coefficient:** This is a measure of how easily molecules can move through the gel. This can be measured using a variety of techniques including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP).

6. **Gel Point:** The gel point is the concentration at which an infinite network forms. It can be detected by various rheological methods, including monitoring the viscoelastic properties of the gel as a function of time or temperature.

7. **Molecular Weight of Gel-forming Polymers:** This is often measured by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) or by Static Light Scattering.

8. **Gel Strength:** Gel strength is usually determined by mechanical methods such as penetration tests (the force necessary to penetrate the gel with a probe of given geometry is measured) or compression tests (the force necessary to compress the gel to a certain extent is measured).

Remember that the appropriate technique will depend on the specific type of gel and the precise nature of the information needed.
